Project: Spreadsheet Web Application

Overview:
Develop a web-based spreadsheet application that allows users to create, view, edit, and delete spreadsheets. The application should present a grid-based interface where users can input and modify cell data, perform basic calculations, and store spreadsheets in a local database. The user interface must be simple, clean, and intuitive, providing an organized layout for managing spreadsheet data. Do not implement any security features such as user authentication or encryption.

Key Features & Requirements:
- Display a grid-based interface representing spreadsheet cells.
- Provide functionality to create new spreadsheets.
- Allow users to input and edit cell values.
- Enable basic calculations within cells (e.g., sum, average).
- Save spreadsheets in a local database.
- Allow users to open, view, and delete existing spreadsheets.
- Use a simple, clean, and user-friendly interface.
- All modifications must provide complete, production-ready files.
- When modifying or adding a file, include the full file content—not just partial updates.
- Organize files into appropriate directories and create subdirectories as needed.
- Do not include any security features (authentication, encryption, etc.).
- Do not include any additional commentary or explanations—output code only.

Output Format:
Please return your output in the following format for each file:
### filename: <relative_path/filename> ###
<complete file content>
### end ###

Additional Instructions:
- Create any new directories required by the file paths.
- Build a working foundation first before adding extra features.
- Always include the complete file content when making modifications.
- Follow the above specifications exactly and do not deviate from the format.

Please generate the complete code implementation for this project according to these specifications.
