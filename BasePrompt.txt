Project: To-Do List Web Application

Overview:
Develop a web-based to-do list application. The application should allow users to add, view, update, and delete tasks. All tasks must be stored in a local database, and the design should be simple and user-friendly with a main page displaying the list of tasks and a form for adding new tasks. Do not implement any security features such as user authentication or encryption.

Key Features & Requirements:
- Display a list of all tasks on the main page.
- Provide a form to add new tasks.
- Allow users to update existing tasks.
- Allow users to delete tasks.
- Store tasks in a local database.
- Use a simple and clean user interface.
- All modifications must provide complete, production-ready files.
- When modifying or adding a file, include the full file content—not just partial updates.
- Organize files into appropriate directories and create subdirectories as needed.
- Do not include any security features (authentication, encryption, etc.).
- Do not include any additional commentary or explanations—output code only.

Output Format:
Please return your output in the following format for each file:
### filename: <relative_path/filename> ###
<complete file content>
### end ###

Additional Instructions:
- Create any new directories required by the file paths.
- Build a working foundation first before adding extra features.
- Always include the complete file content when making modifications.
- Follow the above specifications exactly and do not deviate from the format.

Please generate the complete code implementation for this project according to these specifications.
