The code provided is a good starting point for a basic website selling bananas. However, there are several features missing and improvements that could be made:

1. **Product Images**: The product page lists different types of bananas but does not provide any images. Including images would make the website more visually appealing and help customers make informed decisions.

2. **Shopping Cart**: The `addToCart` function currently only alerts the user that a product has been added to the cart, but there is no actual cart functionality. Implementing a shopping cart where users can review their selected items before purchase would be beneficial.

3. **Form Validation**: The contact form currently does not have any validation beyond the required attribute in the HTML. Adding JavaScript validation could provide more user-friendly error messages and prevent the form from being submitted if the input is not valid.

4. **Responsive Design**: The CSS does not include any media queries for different screen sizes. Adding responsive design would ensure the website looks good on all devices.

5. **SEO Optimization**: The HTML does not include any meta tags for SEO. Adding meta tags would help improve the website's visibility on search engines.

6. **Accessibility**: The website could be improved for accessibility. For example, adding `alt` attributes to images for screen readers, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and adding `aria` attributes where necessary.

7. **Server-side Rendering**: The website is entirely client-side rendered. For improved performance and SEO, consider implementing server-side rendering.

8. **User Authentication**: If you want users to be able to save their shopping cart or have profiles, consider adding user authentication.

9. **Payment Integration**: There is currently no way for users to pay for their bananas. Integrating a payment gateway would be necessary for the store to function.

10. **Unit Tests**: There are no tests included in the code. Adding tests would help ensure the website works as expected as it continues to be developed.
