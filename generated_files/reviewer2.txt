The code you provided seems to be correct and functional. However, there are a few improvements that can be made to enhance the website's usability and maintainability:

1. **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar is repeated in each HTML file. This is not a good practice as it leads to code duplication. If you want to change the navigation bar, you have to change it in every file. However, this issue can't be solved using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You would need a server-side language like PHP or a static site generator like Jekyll to include the navigation bar from a separate file.

2. **Form Validation**: The contact form currently only checks if the fields are not empty. It would be better to also validate the email address format and maybe add a minimum length for the message.

3. **CSS Organization**: The CSS file could be better organized. It's a good practice to separate the styles into sections (e.g., general, header, main, footer) and add comments to describe what each section does.

Here's the improved JavaScript code with email validation:

```javascript
document.getElementById('contactForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Prevent the default form submission
    
    // Get form data
    const name = document.getElementById('name').value;
    const email = document.getElementById('email').value;
    const message = document.getElementById('message').value;

    // Validate email
    const emailRegex = /^[\w-]+(\.[\w-]+)*@([\w-]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,7}$/;
    if (!emailRegex.test(email)) {
        alert('Please enter a valid email address.');
        return;
    }

    // Validate message length
    if (message.length < 10) {
        alert('Your message should be at least 10 characters long.');
        return;
    }

    // Display a response message
    const response = document.getElementById('formResponse');
    response.textContent = `Thank you, ${name}! Your message has been received.`;
    
    // Clear the form
    this.reset();
});
```

Remember that these improvements are suggestions and may not be necessary depending on the scope and purpose of your website.
