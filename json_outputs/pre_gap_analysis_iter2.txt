The code provided is quite comprehensive and covers most of the basic functionalities for an online banana shop. However, there are a few improvements and additions that can be made:

1. **Error Handling:** There is no error handling in the JavaScript code. For instance, in the `addToCart` function, there should be checks to ensure that the quantity is a positive number.

2. **Accessibility:** The website could be improved for accessibility. For example, adding `alt` text to the images for visually impaired users and ensuring that all form elements have associated labels.

3. **Checkout Page:** There is a function `proceedToCheckout()` which redirects to 'checkout.html', but the 'checkout.html' file is not provided. This page is crucial for users to finalize their purchases, enter shipping information, and make payments.

4. **Product Details:** Each product only has a name, image, and price. More details could be added, such as weight, origin, and nutritional information.

5. **User Feedback:** After the user submits the contact form, the form just resets without any confirmation message. It would be better to provide feedback to let the user know that their message has been received.

6. **Validation:** In the contact form, there is a validation for the email format, but not for the name. A validation could be added to ensure that the name only contains letters and whitespace.

7. **Security:** The website lacks security measures. For example, it does not have CSRF tokens for the forms, which leaves it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.

8. **Responsive Design:** Although there is some responsive design in the CSS, more could be done to ensure the website looks good on all devices. For example, the navigation menu could be collapsed into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

9. **SEO:** The website could be improved for search engine optimization. For example, adding meta tags for keywords and author, and ensuring that all images have alt text.

10. **JavaScript Syntax Error:** There is a syntax error in the `displayCart` function. The forEach loop should use parentheses instead of curly braces. It should be `cart.forEach((item, index) => {...});` instead of `cart.forEach{item, index) => {...});`.

11. **Empty Cart Handling:** There is no handling for an empty cart. If the cart is empty, the user should be notified when they visit the cart page or click on the "Proceed to Checkout" button.
