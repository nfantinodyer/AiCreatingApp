# How to Run the File Sharing Application

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   python3 -m venv venv

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - On macOS and Linux:

     source venv/bin/activate

   - On Windows:

     venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install Required Dependencies**

   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Set Environment Variables**

   - For development purposes, you can set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. If not set, a random key will be generated each time the app runs.

   export SECRET_KEY='your_secret_key'

   - To enable debug mode, set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `True`:

   export DEBUG=True

   On Windows Command Prompt:

   set SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   set DEBUG=True

5. **Initialize the Database**

   The database and necessary tables will be automatically created when you run the application for the first time.

6. **Run the Application**

   python app.py

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` by default.

## Usage

1. **Register a New User**

   Visit the registration page and create a new account.

2. **Login**

   Use your credentials to log in.

3. **Upload Files**

   Navigate to the upload page to upload your files. Allowed file types are: `txt`, `pdf`, `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`.

4. **Manage Files**

   - **Download:** Download your uploaded files.
   - **Share:** Generate shareable links to allow others to download your files without logging in.
   - **Delete:** Remove your files from the server.

## Notes

- Uploaded files are encrypted on the server for security.
- Shareable links are unique and can be shared with others to allow file downloads.
- Logs are maintained in the `app.log` file with rotation to manage log size.
